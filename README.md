# TwitterImgSaverCmd
A command line-based project that takes in Twitter tweet/image links and saves all attached images. A skeleton project to form the basis for the next step, a proper user app with UI.

Currently satisfied with present state of the code, as there is not much room for useful and meaningful upgrade compared to the effort to implement them.
Possible upgrades include: creating UI, allowing save to multiple directories, more functions(commands)
